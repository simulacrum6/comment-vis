# Research Project

This project aims to support users in evaluating and understanding large quantities of textual feedback quickly and efficiently.
This is achieved by clustering posts which refer to the same aspect and providing an interactive visualisation to explore the feedback in more detail.

The clustering aggregates posts with similar meaning under the same category and extracts the core aspect, shared among all posts under the given category.
In addition to the clustering, more detailed information about each individual post is also extracted. Posts are analyzed with regards to their sentiment and whether a more nuanced meaning can be extracted from it. \
The visualisation allows users to explore different perspectives on their data, such as general sentiment, relevance and relationships between feedback categories.\
**TODO:** Add detailed description. 

## NLP Approaches

* Naive approach: Use k most frequent _Content Words?_ as category. _Modifiers?_ related to Content Words as attributes.
* Approach A: Transform feedback into vector representation. Cluster into groups (Graph Clustering, RBF Nets?). Run _Keyword Extraction?_ on clusters to get _Category_. (Run sentiment analysis on feedback 


## Scratchpad

* Read paper from NLP Highlights. _More research? Existing Neural Models?_
* Sentence alignment.
sentences.)
* Terms to research for: Alignment, Sentence paraphrase detection, Sentiment Analysis.
